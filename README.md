## README.md!

This is a README.md file for Team Magic Conch Shell's Library Management Project.

**Phase 2**

***Updates after Monday's presentation:**

1. We have implemented all of our controller classes and connected our webpages with back-end codes. Here's a demo video
that shows the functionality of our program: https://play.library.utoronto.ca/watch/b3326f07f1cbe6d10bfc68860a7f32f1


2. To run the program, first run the Application in src.main.java.com.bookSystem, then open a new web page and enter
the link http://localhost:8080/login. Test account in our video can be used to log in.


3. To connect to our MongoDB online datebase, use the link mongodb+srv://Hewitt:C*gh8%40f8R*9Hw%40U@cluster0.hmi0f.mongodb.net/User?retryWrites=true&w=majority

   Data in MongoDB are stored in two directories: User and Book.

report, please visit [phase2](phase2).


- Note: Errors may occur in studentBorrowBook.html since IntelliJ may not be compatible with Spring boot sometimes, however it 
won't affect the function of our program when we run the application.
