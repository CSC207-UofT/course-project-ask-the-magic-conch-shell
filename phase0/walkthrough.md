**Scenario walk-through**

*Note: All terms in **bold** are our classes of entities /use cases /controllers.

`Scenario 1 - Students’ perspective`

In order to borrow a book in the library, a student needs to:

1. Go to the library, provide personal information to the staff. After in-person verification from the staff, the staff 
is able to use the **LoginWindow**, then call **UserManager** to create a new account for the student **(Student Entity)**. The 
student would get a new username and a temporary password. Once registered, the **Student** would have a default credit 
score of 100 and an empty current-borrowing history.


2. Sign in from the **LoginWindow** using username and password. After receiving username and password input from user,
**LoginWindow** would check into **UserManager**, find the **Student** that stored in the **UserManager** using the input, 
and get the password stored in that **Student**, pass it to **LoginWindow** and check whether it matches with the input 
password from the user.


3. A student can also change the password after logging in. The **LoginWindow** would be used to send a request to 
**UserManager**, find the **Student** account and then change it into a new password using the setter in **Student.**


4. To borrow a book, students need to use the **BorrowBook** controller. **BorrowBook** is able to call **BookManager** and 
**UserManager** to search the Book, check the inventory and the status of the **Book** to see whether it can be borrowed, and 
the credit score and current-borrowing record of the **Student** will be checked to see if the student is qualified to 
borrow the book. After the book is successfully borrowed, **BookManager** can be used to change the book status to LENDED, 
modify Return Date and the inventory of this book.

   

`Scenario 2 - Staff’s perspective`

1. When a new book arrives at the library, the staff is able to login to a staff account through **LoginWindow** and
add the book using the **BookManager** through the **InventoryController** by inputting all of its information.


2. The **Book** itself would store information like its ID, name, ISBN, publish date, author, status(lent or not), 
Return Date (new books have null return date).


3. When the book is physically returned to the library, staff will login to their account through **LoginWindow**, 
use **ReturnBook** and input the id of the book and its condition, and then call **BookManager** to return the book by 
changing its status, as well as adding one to the inventory of the book. If the condition of the book is damaged, call 
**BookManager** to delete this book from the inventory.


4. If a student forgets his/her password, he/she needs to contact a staff in-person. After verification, the staff is able
to change the password for the student by login to a staff account from the **LoginWindow.** After sending a request to
**UserManager**, find the **Student** account and then change it into a new password using the setter in **Student**.
Then, the staff can give the new password to the student.
