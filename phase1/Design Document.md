**Design Document for Phase 1 - Team Magic Conch Shell**

Design Document
This is arguably the most important part of your project â€” even more important than the code itself! Don't wait until the day before phase 1 is due to start writing it. It should be developed as you go and you should just need to polish it up before the due date. And you'll hand in a revised version of this document for phase 2 as well, so the more effort you put into it now, the more feedback we can give you so that it is even better at the end of the term!

Your TA will start by reading this document when they grade your project, so make a good first impression!

The document should include:

Your updated specification.
Briefly highlight any additional functionality that you have implemented between phase 0 and the end of phase 1.
Optionally, include a well-formatted diagram of your code. This is called a class diagram (Links to an external site.), and there is an international standard called the Unified Modelling Language (Links to an external site.) (UML) that describes them in detail. However! Please don't worry about the details, just use boxes and arrows like we do in the slides. If you're curious, you can create a full UML class diagram for all or part (at your group's discretion) of your program.
NOTE 1: This can really help your TA understand what you did, but if presented poorly it won't be of much use.
NOTE 2: If you have access to the Pro version of IntelliJ, it can generate class diagrams for you, but make sure it is well formatted if you hand one in!
A description of any major design decisions your group has made (along with brief explanations of why you made them).
A brief description of how your project adheres to Clean Architecture (if you notice a violation and aren't sure how to fix it, talk about that too!)
A brief description of how your project is consistent with the SOLID design principles (if you notice a violation and aren't sure how to fix it, talk about that too!)
A brief description of which packaging strategies you considered, which you decided to use, and why. (see slide 7 from the packages slides)
A summary of any design patterns your group has implemented (or plans to implement).
A progress report
open questions your group is struggling with
what has worked well so far with your design
a summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next
