**Design Document for Phase 1 - Team Magic Conch Shell**


`1. Updated Specification`

 This is our updated version of [specification](phase1specification.md). Compare to phase0, one of the main changes
is that we add different Search Algorithm. Student users now can search books by **their ISBN, type and author** 
rather than can just input the book's id before. Here we made an overall [UML Diagram](UML.pdf).
 
Another main change in our functionality is that we implemented **MongoDB** as our database to store all students, staff and 
books data as a method to let the state become persistent across runs of our program. More specifically, we created three
database(student, staff and book) in MongoDB, and we implemented methods that allow us to save, read and update information
of our entities.


`2. Major design decisions`

- As we mentioned before, we implemented **MongoDB** to store our data persistently. Therefore, we add a gateway package named
com.application.MongoDBGateway to store all the gateway class and methods that we can use to store, read and update information. 
MongoDB class enables us to connect to MongoDB. MongoDBStudentMethods contains methods like _checkStudent_, which gets a
username input and check whether the student is in the Student database. If the student is not in the database, we can 
add the username, password, Credit score and Borrowing Record to the database through _addStudent_. Student's information
can also be checked and changed when they want to change their passwords or their credit scores need to be adjusted when returning 
books using _get..._ and _update_. Similarly, MongoBDStaffMethods have these methods for staff database and MongoDBBookMethods 
is used to add, delete and update book information and has different search algorithm for the books.
For detailed database information, please see [MongoDBOverview](MongoDBOverview.pdf).



- For our front-end, we have completed **the html** part to demonstrate how our website is intended to look like. For now, we 
are using the "location.href" to let the website switch between different pages and navigate.
Since we have already converted this Book Management System into **a Spring Boot framework**, all of our existing files should
be in their designated packages. The frontend files are in the **"resources"** package, with html files in the **"template"** 
folder and the other icons planned for phase 2 will be put into the **"static"** folder. The backend java files can be found 
in main/java, including the com.application.controller files. Please note that the com.application.controller might look slightly different when we enter 
phase2 since the com.application.controller is not yet connected to the frontend, meaning the Spring Boot annotation is not yet implemented.




`3. Design Patterns`


1. **Dependency-Injection:** With the implementation of com.application.MongoDBGateway, we refactored the code from phase0 using the 
dependency-injection design pattern. We first created three interfaces for three gateway class, then we 'injected' these
interfaces into our use cases, so that our use cases are able to **call methods from gateway without the violation of 
clean architecture principles.** More specifically, we split our original UserManger into two new use cases: DBUserManager 
and UserLoginManager, where DBUserManager manages all users stored in the database and UserLoginManager manage the user
entity is currently login. These two use cases would have gateway user methods interfaces inject into their methods' 
parameter. Similarly, DBbookManager use methods from IMongoDBBookMethods in its parameters. (Implemented at pull request
no.7 and was updated in later pull requests.)

- **A scenario walk-through for this design pattern:** When a student wants to login, checkStudent() methods from the 
IDBUserManager would be called from the LoginWindow com.application.controller. Then, this method in the use case would call the gateway
interface IMongoDBStudentMethods to check whether the username he inputted is in the student database, if yes, we then call
other methods in the gateway interface for our use case to get all information of this student like credit score and borrowing
record. After getting these information, we construct a new student entity with them and store it inside the UserLoginManager, 
return to the com.application.controller to let him log in.


2. **Command:** In phase2, we are planning to add a new **"shopping cart"** feature to further expand our functionality.
For now, students can just borrow one book at a time by inputting book id and staff can only return a book at a time. 
With this function, they can borrow/return several books at a time. In order to implement it, we need to use the command
design pattern. For example, the **base classes** should be each subclass of books. 

- **A scenario walk-through for this design pattern:**
When a student uses placeInCart() in the **invoker**, this book will be stored in a list in 
“command invoker”, just like the book is being put into a shopping cart. At the end, student can use borrowAllBooks() 
from the invoker, and will be told whether he/she has successfully borrowed each book or not.




`4. Clean architecture & Packaging strategies`


In terms of clean architecture, as we mentioned in the last section, we used the **dependency injection** design pattern to 
avoid the violation of clean architecture principles. Besides, we extract interfaces from our use cases for implementations 
of the controllers. (For examples of this, please see **the UML diagram** in part1 and the **scenario walk-through** in part 3.)


We also reorganized our codes from phase0 and used **the clean architecture layer packaging strategy** because
we have more use cases and a new section of gateway methods right now, this strategy is more suitable for us to organize
our codes, and it can also act as a reminder for us to not violate the clean architecture principles. Right now we have
two packages to store entity "Book" and "User", one "com.application.UseCase" package, one "com.application.controller" package and one "com.application.MongoDBGateway" 
package for our codes.



`5. SOLID principle`

In phase1 we split our original UserManager use case to DBUserManager and UserLoginManager because we changed the methods
to store our data. The use case DBUserManager manages all users stored in the database and UserLoginManager manage the user
entity is currently login. This follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** that each class should have only a single 
responsibility, instead of managing all users and the current user in the same class, we split them into two.


Our design to extract interfaces for use cases and gateways follows the **Interface Segregation Principle** that we created
specific interfaces for other classes to call. Our implementation of dependency injection pattern follows the **Dependency
Inversion Principle.**


However, we have a problem because MongoDB is not able to store the entities we created directly, so we need to take out 
the attributes from our entities and store them in the forms of String and int, which resulted in the duplication of 
some codes. We have some methods with long method bodies, so we are planning to extract helper methods from them. Besides,
since we are using Spring boot for html UI, we are planning to transfer our MongoDB gateway methods to the built-in
MongoDB connector in Spring boot. In this way, we may directly store the entities in the database.


`6. Progress report`

**open questions our group is struggling with:**

1. For now, we have a 'forget password' method for student users, when they forget their passwords they can come to the
staff and ask them to modify to a new password. However, we did not provide a method like this for staff. 
If they forget their passwords, is it better for us to have an account like "Admin" to perform this method, or we can just
simply give other staff the ability to modify each other's password?


2. We have a question related to the library. In order to implement connections with MongoDB, we need to add several .jar
files as library, however, when we push or update from main, we need to add them again. We think this is related to 
the iml file in .idea directory. What does it do? Does it act like a library?


3. How do we call the methods of use cases through their interfaces in the controllers since they do not have a 
constructor. Do we just simple write _xxClass extends xxxinterface_?


4. We discovered that we could have used the mongodb repository in Spring Boot for our database gateway at the very last
moment before our due date. Would it be necessary to use this Spring Boot feature in phase 2 and is there any other 
benefits to it other than just saving some code?


**what has worked well so far:** 

- We have implemented codes for entities, use cases, controllers and gateways to connect databases.

- We have implemented most part of the **tests** for **entities and newly updated use-case classes** (see test directory). We 
are planning to test our **controllers** as well after finishing its implementation with spring boot as in the next phase. 

- We know how to make use of **github features**. In phase0, we have the trouble of losing
files when push and pull from our group repository. In phase1, we have learned how to use the pull request feature and 
this problem never appeared again.
